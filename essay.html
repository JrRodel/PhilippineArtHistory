                        Traveling from ancient times artworks up until today’s canvas discovery, Philippine visual arts history always appears to be rich and vibrant over the years. Through this, the Filipino way of living such as the traditions, customs, and cultural expressions has been continuously showcased and developed over time.
                        <br><br>
                        Even before foreign colonizers invade our country, our Filipino ancestors have expressed their storis, beliefs, and ideas through visual arts. This is the medium they used in order to communicate by seeing, doing, and interpreting the arts purpose. In this period, our forefathers are skillful when it comes to paintings, carving, weaving, and pottery making. Painting includes doing tattoos or what they called the Pintados or painted ones in which they used sharp objects which will be heated by the fire and will be marked in the body. Some of its examples are it is used to imitate the upper clothing worn by the men of North Kalinga while the women painted red on their faces and this is called Silup as well as the Angono Petroglyphs which is the Philippine’s oldest known artwork composed of 127 humans and animals engraved on a rock wall. On the other hand, they were also able to do a wood carving such as Bul-Ul or the carved anito of Ifugao’s known as “Guardians of Harvest”. Hagabi or the wooden chair of Ifugao’s, Sarimanok as one of the old designs with different stories of existence. Manunggul Jar which is used for burial rites by the Palawan ancient people, and Jewelry which are used by the people who belong to an upper class and royal families. They also learned the art of architecture as they discover how to hunt food and as they move such as Lean-to, Tausug House, Ifugao House or “Bale” and Torongan which are the early shelters made in this time.
                        <br><br>
                        Moving on to the next period when the Spaniards arrived in the 16th century, they brought new creative influences with them, blending indigenous traditions with European styles. Religious themes predominated in early colonial art, as evidenced by the ornately decorated churches and religious paintings. The combination of indigenous elements and European techniques resulted in the development of a distinct Filipino visual language known as "indio art." During the initial centuries of Spanish colonization, only religious symbols were painted. Churches began to often display portraits of the Holy Family and saints. The Via Crucis, the crucifixion, the passion of Christ, and representations of heaven, purgatory, and hell are among the other topics covered. In addition, the Spanish brought new mediums and methods such as oil painting and stone carving to the Philippines. Filipino artists adopted these methods fast, interpreting religious subjects in their own distinctive ways.
                        <br><br>
                        Furthermore, the early 20th-century American colonialism of the Philippines had an additional impact on the growth of Philippine visual arts. New concepts and styles, such abstraction and realism, were brought to the world by American academics and artists. Filipino artists started experimenting with these new forms and blending traditional components with modern creations. Also, several significant Filipino artists emerged during this time, such as Fernando Amorsolo embraced the beauty of rural life, and nationalistic themes became prevalent. Bright color schemes and the depiction of rural settings came to define this era and Juan Luna, whose well-known work "Spoliarium" captured the savagery of the Spanish colonial government.
                        <br><br>
                        During World War II, the Japanese occupation of the Philippines had a profound impact on the art world. Many artists employed their works as a means of opposition, while some worked in tandem with the new government. Art evolved as a means of expressing hope for freedom, preserving cultural identity, and recording the tragedies of war. Artists like Carlos "Botong" Francisco and Vicente Manansala persisted in producing works that honor Filipino resiliency and subtly expressed opposition to war under severe repression. The "Modern Art Project," which sought to develop a distinctive Filipino art style that drew inspiration from indigenous and contemporary styles, also emerged around this period.
                        <br><br>
                        After the war, there was a period of reflection and rebirth in Philippine art. Artists tackled social and political themes like poverty, inequality, and the legacy of colonialism by experimenting with social realism, abstract expressionism, and conceptual art. The pursuit of a unique Filipino identity and the impact of social realism emerged as motivating factors. Among others, Vicente Manansala and H.R. Ocampo experimented with abstract and symbolic shapes to express their ideas. Moreover, the spirit of post-war Filipino life was encapsulated in Benedicto Cabrera's "Jeepney" series, while Arturo Luz's abstract paintings revealed a profound investigation of individual feelings and experiences.
                        <br><br>
                        Lastly, the visual arts of the Philippines have expanded in diversity and vibrancy in the modern world. It is flourishing at the moment as today's artists remain deeply rooted in their cultural heritage while drawing inspiration from a globalized environment. Filipino artists are always pushing the boundaries, whether it be in traditional mediums like folk art or cutting-edge digital technology. They work in a variety of media, including photography, video, sculpture, and painting. Their writings tackle universal issues such as social justice, climate change, and the human condition while keeping a distinctively Filipino viewpoint.
                        <br><br>
                        With that, the development of Philippine visual arts over time is a reflection of the people's inventiveness and persistence in embracing and transforming a variety of influences. Filipino artists have made a name for themselves on the international scene from the pre-colonial era onward by telling stories, upholding customs, and always adapting to reflect the dynamic nature of the world as a whole. The vivid tapestry of Philippine visual arts, which is a monument to the resilient spirit of a country, is something we appreciate as we reflect on this artistic journey. From the modest carvings of our ancestors to the intricate and varied art forms we see today, the visual arts of the Philippines have gone a long way. Our art has always represented our culture, values, and life experiences. It continues to motivate us to build a better future for ourselves and future generations by giving voice to our challenges and aspirations.
