                          <p>
                            The video showcases the different visual arts in the Philippines from the different eras. It started with artworks from the Pre-colonial era, then showcases arts from the period when the country was colonized by the Spanish, American, and Japanese.  Lastly, it also includes artworks from the post-war and contemporary arts. 
                            <br><br>
                            The artworks from the pre-colonial era are the Angono Petroglyphs, Silup, and Bul-ul. The Angono Petroglyphs are said to be earliest artwork in the Philippines which are carvings of figures made on the walls in order to tell a story. Silup are art that is inked on the body of a person which shows the Filipino’s tattoo culture in the past. And Bul-ul sculptures are figures which are traditionally used for ceremonies and rituals.
                            <br><br>
                            The first two artworks from the Spanish era ae Spoliarium by Juan Luna and Las Virgenes Cristianas Expuestas al Populacho and Felix Hidalgo which both showcases the state of the Filipino citizens during that period. The next artwork presented in the video is Langit Lupa at Impiyerno by Josef Luciano Dans and it is currently located in the Church of Paete. Primeras Letras by Simon Flores is the next painting that was shown which showcases a mother that is teaching her child how to read. The last artwork from this era is The Basi Revolt by Esteban Villanueva which is a set of paintings which are meant to express a story of the events in the history of the country. 
                            <br><br>
                            Women Working in a Rice Field by Fabian De La Rosa is the first artwork for the American colonization era that was shown in the video. This artwork represents the way of life of Filipinos as they do labor. The next painting was the Making of the Philippine Flag by Fernando Amorsolo, showing how the country’s flag was created by and put together. Sungkaan is a painting by Jorge Pineda showing Filipinos playing a traditional game of Sungka. The remaining paintings from this era are Ireneo Miranda’s Tausug Princess which is also called the Portrait of Santanina Tillah Rasul and Pablor Armosolo’s Fruit Vendor.
                            <br><br>
                            Most of the artworks from the Japanese colonization era represents how badly Filipinos were treated by Japanese soldiers during war. These paintings are named Rape and Massacre in Ermita by Diosdado Lorenzo, Doomed Family by Dominador Castaneda, Capas by Demetria Diego, and Defense of a Filipina Woman’s Honor by Fernando Amorsolo. All of these paintings depict the experience of Filipinos during that time as they are physically and sexually abused, treated violently, and killed. On the other hand, Christmas Eve by Emilio Santiago illustrates a mother looking over her sleeping child during the season of Christmas.
                            <br><br>
                            The rest of the art shown in the video were created post-war. The first artwork is Madonna in the Slums by Vicente Manansala which shows the living conditions of some Filipinos and where they are inhabited. Bayanihan by Carlos Francisco was also shown and this artwork depicts a tradition of Filipinos where they help each other out lift the nipa hut of their fellow citizens in order to transfer homes. Artworks by Benedicto Cabrera were then showcased as he is a contemporary artist which uses paintings as one of his media in art. The sculptures of Agnes Arellano were also displayed. The ones included in the video are entitled Tatlong Buddhang Ina, Haliya, Project Pleiades, Temple to the Moon Goddess, and The Goddess Revisited. And the last clip for contemporary arts is a video by Martha Atienza entitled “Our Islands” which was a shot taken in Cebu.
                            <br><br>
                            The first clip is from Frances Avila, which is a video of Chocolate Hills located in the province of Bohol. The background music used in the video is Sa Kabukiran by Sylvia La Torre, also known as the queen of kundiman. This song was released during the post-war era in the Philippines. The pictures and video of the visual arts were sourced mainly on google; credits go to their rightful owners. The video is edited by Valerie Francisco.
                            <br><br>
                            The video is meant to show the different visual arts in the Philippines so that we could appreciate further appreciate them. From paintings, to sculptures, to tattoos, these are what makes us Filipinos and shows our culture.
